Task 1: Explore why imbalanced datasets are problematic for classification algorithms. <br />
Task 2: Use R to explore a dataset.<br />
Task 3: Create random testing and training datasets using the caret package in R. <br />
Task 4: Use R to synthetically balance your training dataset using three techniques from the smotefamily package. <br />
Task 5: Train three classification algorithms (decision tree, na√Øve Bayes, and linear discriminant analysis) using the natively imbalanced dataset, and generate the predictions for the test dataset. <br />
Task 6: Use R to visually compare your models using the recall, precision, and F measure classification accuracy metrics. <br />
