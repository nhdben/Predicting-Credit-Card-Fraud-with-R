# Predicting-Credit-Card-Fraud-

This project helped me understand how to deal with classification bias for highly imbalanced datasets, I used R to identify fraudulent credit card transactions with a variety of classification methods. <br />
Since the class of interest (fraud) represents less than 1% of the observations, I had to generate synthetic samples to address the issue. <br />

The project is devided into 6 main tasks: <br />

Task 1: Explore why imbalanced datasets are problematic for classification algorithms. <br />
Task 2: Use R to explore a dataset.<br />
Task 3: Create random testing and training datasets using the caret package in R. <br />
Task 4: Use R to synthetically balance the training dataset using three techniques from the [smotefamily package.](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/smotefamily/versions/1.3.1/topics/SMOTE) <br />
Task 5: Train three classification algorithms (decision tree, na√Øve Bayes, and linear discriminant analysis) using the natively imbalanced dataset, and generate the predictions for the test dataset. <br />
Task 6: Use R to visually compare the models using the recall, precision, and F measure classification accuracy metrics. <br />
